# Wave Simulator

This project is a 2D wave simulation built in C++ with OpenGL. It models wave propagation in a mirror-bound box using a discrete wave equation. Waves reflect, interfere, and form standing or chaotic patterns, allowing for exploration of wave dynamics, interference, and emergent behavior.

## Features

- Discrete 2D wave propagation
- Reflective boundary conditions
- Interference patterns and standing waves
- Real-time visualization using OpenGL

## Installation

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher.
2. Install OpenGL and GLFW (and any required dependencies like GLAD).
3. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/WaveSimulator.git
```

4. Build and run using your preferred build system (e.g., Makefile, CMake).

## Usage

- Run the executable to start the simulation.
- Observe wave interference patterns and experiment with initial conditions.
- Modify source locations or wave parameters in the code to explore different behaviors.

## Notes

- External dependencies (GLFW, GLAD) are **not included**; you must install them locally.
- This project is primarily for educational and exploratory purposes in physics-based simulations.
